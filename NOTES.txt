Note 1:
When referencing other models, make sure it matches their schema name.
For example we have the user model, the shema name it has when it is being registered to models
is "user" with all no caps, the error I encountered was that
the reference being used in ohter models is "User" with 
uppercase. This throws an error, the "User" is not registered or something.
